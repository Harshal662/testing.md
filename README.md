## Have precision in our operations, risk management and controls

Ans - To align with the objective of having precision in operations, risk management, and controls, you can highlight the following measures:

1. **Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability in Automated Testing**:
   - Developed automated test scripts that validate API and UI functionalities against defined standards, ensuring precision and compliance with project requirements.
   - Regularly reviewed and updated automated tests to reflect changes in application functionality, ensuring accurate and reliable test outcomes.
   - Monitored automated test results closely to detect and address any discrepancies, ensuring that the testing process remains dependable.

2. **Strengthening Controls through Automated Testing**:
   - Implemented automated tests that enforce key controls, such as data validation and security checks, to ensure adherence to relevant rules, regulations, and company policies.
   - Created automated regression tests to validate critical functionalities and control measures, reducing the risk of defects slipping into production.
   - Proactively identified areas where manual testing posed risks, introducing automation to minimize errors and improve control over testing outcomes.

3. **Proactively Managing Risks in the Testing Process**:
   - Used test data and analytics to identify potential risks in the testing processes, implementing preemptive measures to mitigate them.
   - Implemented automated alerts for test failures, allowing for rapid response to issues and reducing potential impacts on the overall quality of deliverables.
   - Escalated identified risks or persistent issues to the relevant stakeholders and recommended improvements for better risk management.

4. **Aligning with Training, Policies, and Standards**:
   - Ensured that all automated test scripts were developed and maintained in accordance with company policies, coding standards, and best practices.
   - Kept updated with changes in company guidelines, adapting automated testing processes to remain compliant with any new rules or standards.
   - Participated in relevant training sessions to enhance knowledge of operational standards, applying learnings to further improve the accuracy and precision of testing efforts.

These measures demonstrate how you have maintained precision in your operations, improved risk management, and strengthened controls in your automation and testing work.
