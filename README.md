To achieve your goal, you can create a third Java Maven project or file that calls the other two projects or classes. Below is an example demonstrating how you can do this:

### Assumptions
1. **Code Structure:** The two existing Java Maven codes are structured as classes with a `getMap()` method that returns a `Map<String, String>`.
2. **Dependencies:** Both codes are either in the same package or available as dependencies in your Maven project.
3. **Execution:** The third code will instantiate these classes, call the `getMap()` method, and combine or print the results.

Hereâ€™s the Java code for the third class:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CombineMaps {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate the classes from the two Maven projects
        FirstClass firstInstance = new FirstClass();
        SecondClass secondInstance = new SecondClass();

        // Call the methods to get the maps
        Map<String, String> firstMap = firstInstance.getMap();
        Map<String, String> secondMap = secondInstance.getMap();

        // Combine or print the maps
        System.out.println("Map from FirstClass: " + firstMap);
        System.out.println("Map from SecondClass: " + secondMap);

        // Combine both maps into a single map
        Map<String, String> combinedMap = new HashMap<>();
        combinedMap.putAll(firstMap);
        combinedMap.putAll(secondMap);

        // Print the combined map
        System.out.println("Combined Map: " + combinedMap);
    }
}
```

### Steps to Implement
1. **Add Dependencies (if needed):**  
   If the first two codes are in separate Maven projects, add them as dependencies in the `pom.xml` of the third project:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>first-project</artifactId>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>second-project</artifactId>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Ensure Package Structure:**  
   Make sure the packages are correctly imported in the third class. Use the correct import statements for `FirstClass` and `SecondClass`.

3. **Compile and Run:**  
   - Build all three Maven projects using `mvn clean install`.
   - Execute the `CombineMaps` class to see the output.

### Customizations
If the two codes take input parameters or require specific setups (like database connections or configuration files), you need to include those setups in your third code.

Feel free to share more details about your specific setup if further customization is needed!
