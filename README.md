Hi [Manager’s Name], I recently applied for the Platform Engineer role and wanted to briefly share my background.  

In my current role, I’ve been working on Java Spring Boot and Angular development, focusing on building scalable and high-quality solutions. Alongside this, I’ve gained exposure to platform engineering areas such as Docker (building and configuring images), AWS (deploying Flask APIs, Lambda jobs, S3), Jenkins (automation packs, deployments, pods), ELK/Kibana dashboards, and YAML-based deployments.  

I also received a promotion last year in recognition of my contributions, and I was part of a team that won a recent hackathon where we built an AI-powered solution using Azure AI, Power Automate, and Power Apps.  

I’m a quick learner, and platform engineering genuinely interests me as the next step in my career. I believe my combination of strong development skills, platform exposure, and proven growth within the organization aligns well with the expectations of the role.  

I’d love the opportunity to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team.
